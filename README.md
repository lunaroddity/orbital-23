A mobile e-commerce app created for the NUS population to facilitate a convenient and efficient way to buy and sell within the community.

## Motivation
Many students operate (or wish to operate) small businesses in their free time as a means to explore their interest while simultaneously turning it into a source of revenue. They often utilise platforms such as Instagram to showcase and promote their products. However, they may not know where to start. In addition, other small businesses from all over the world compete to promote their own products on the same platforms. Hence, these aspiring entrepreneurs may struggle to establish their small business and find a solid customer base.

We aim to create a platform where students can focus on developing their entrepreneurial spirit in a safe environment. This platform will enable them to focus on laying the foundations of their businesses and providing high-quality products and services to their customers. <br />
This is done through: 
- Limiting the user base to NUS students
1. This allows students to promote their products and services without having to worry about having to compete with others internationally. 
2. This allows more security and convenience in buying and selling as it only occurs within the NUS community.
- Verifying accounts using the NUS email
1. This would create a sense of trust since all accounts are tagged to a legitimate person, ensuring that all users are members or NUS, thus reducing the likelihood of scams on the platform.
